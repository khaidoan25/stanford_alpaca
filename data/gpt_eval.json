Machine learning algorithms use statistical techniques to find patterns in data that traditional programming does not detect. Traditional programming is a coding process that requires direct instructions to process data and produce results. It does not learn from experience and relies on rules-based programming to process data."

Additionally, deep learning models can be prone to overfitting, meaning they may be able to achieve high accuracy on the training set but then perform poorly on unseen data."
